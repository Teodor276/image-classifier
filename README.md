# Face Expression Classifier ‚Äì Machine Learning Deployment Project

## üìñ Project Overview

This project covers **end-to-end ML deployment**:

- Building, tuning, and evaluating multiple models on a facial expression dataset.
- Selecting the best-performing model based on test metrics.
- Retraining the best model on the **entire dataset** for optimal performance.
- Exporting the trained model using `pickle`.
- Deploying the model via **FastAPI** so it can accept images and return predictions.

## üõ†Ô∏è What This Repository Contains

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning

- Loads the dataset, checks for missing values, and ensures consistent formatting.
- Performs **feature engineering** where needed.
- Saves the cleaned data for model training.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building

- Trains multiple ML models, including Random Forest and SVM.
- Performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Compares models using different metrics.
- Selects the **best model**, then retrains it on 100% of the dataset for final export.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Deployment

- Uses **FastAPI** to build a REST API that accepts uploaded images.
- The backend performs image preprocessing (grayscale, face detection, wavelet transform).
- The preprocessed image is fed into the trained model to return predicted labels and probabilities.

## üñºÔ∏è Image Handling with OpenCV

This project uses the **`cv2` (OpenCV)** library for:

- **Face and eye detection:** Utilizes OpenCV‚Äôs pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers to detect faces and eyes within an image.
- **Preprocessing:** Converts images to grayscale and applies wavelet transforms to enhance feature extraction before passing the image to the model.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitation:** The model requires a face with **exactly two eyes detected** to make a prediction. If a face or both eyes are not detected, the image is discarded. This is a limitation of OpenCV‚Äôs Haar cascade detection, which may fail on images with poor lighting, occlusions, or extreme angles.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a **complete machine learning deployment pipeline**, starting from data cleaning and model training to real-world deployment using FastAPI. By incorporating **OpenCV for image preprocessing**, we enable the application to handle user-submitted images effectively, ensuring meaningful predictions only when valid face and eye detections are made.
